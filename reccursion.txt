Recursion - is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on the solution to smaller instance of the same problem

Recursion is a function call itself 

we can breakdown our problem into smaller version of sme problem,recursion is very useful 


every recursive solutions need to have a base cas - a condition to terminate the recursion
